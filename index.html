											<h2>What Is D-Door?</h2>

										<p>D-Door is a system that can be installed on any dog door, locking and unlocking it, based on the dog's
										proximity. By making your dog door smart, the system prevents other unwanted animals to go in - and it gives your dogs
										the ability to use their collar to unlock the door as they wish. </p>

									<h2>How Did We Start?</h2>
									<p>Everything started when Renan Mougenot was talking to his father-in-law about the dog door they installed in their house. He said that the dog door always being opened was worrying. Any unwanted animals could come through the door.
									Right there, D-Door started. After brainstorming, Renan Mougenot decided to find a safe and technological solution to the problem. He decided to use his Senior Capstone for <a href="https://www.weber.edu/ece/computer-engineering.html" target="_blank" >Weber State University's Electrical and Computer Department</a> to
									develop and improve his idea.
									Renan Mougenot Breviglieri Silva created
									the D-Door system based on the need of those around him, and decided to develop the idea into a functioning project. Aiming to solve the problem that current dog doors on the market have (its lack of security and selection),
									those were the first two items aborded while developing the D-Door. Components,
									functionality, and much more were decided throughout of the Senior Capstone. After months of programming, communication, and documentation, a prototype was designed and 3D printed, and taken to the WSU Senior Demonstration Day - to demonstrate the working prototype.
									Now, we have a beautiful design, easy interface, battery optimization, and much more - all because we are thinking about the customers and their dogs. So thank you for being part of the D-Door Community!
